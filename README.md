some fun with Perl

So I did this workshop this past weekend using RegEx, which I don't know a lot about
(besides some of the libraries I used in Java a while ago).
I'm getting a breadth of understanding where RegEx comes from by doing a little Perl today. 
I know absolutely nothing about Perl, where it's from, etc, except that a relative of mine
uses it/used to use it daily.
